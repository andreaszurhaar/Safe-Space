Peoples interactions with negative comments have increased over the years, especially in a world where everyone is on social media. In 2014, a Pew Research Center study found that about 66 percent of internet users who have experienced online harassment said their most recent incident occurred on a social networking site or app. A lot of these comments could be automatically filtered out and altered to be positive in order to ensure that people have a more positive experience online. That is the inspiration for this research, and this is why we have produced natural language processing techniques in order to mark negative comments and then transform them into positive comments. 

\noindent In this paper these techniques are introduced and explained. Following this, results of the various experiments conducted on these techniques will be showcased and examined. These experiments revolve around how changes to the censorship techniques can improve or degrade the accuracy of the outputted censored comment. A section that includes ways to further the research is also included, finally ending with a conclusion of the results of everything discussed.
